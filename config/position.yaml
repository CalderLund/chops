# Position configuration (CAGED system)
# Each position is a significant skill to master

entry_point: E

# CAGED positions - E-shape is the classic "box 1" pentatonic
# Most players learn E-shape first, then expand from there
positions:
  - id: E
    next: [D, G]  # Gateway - can expand up (D) or down (G) the neck

  - id: D
    next: [C]  # Continue up the neck

  - id: C
    next: [A]  # Connect to A

  - id: A
    next: []  # End of this direction

  - id: G
    next: []  # End of this direction (can always go back)
