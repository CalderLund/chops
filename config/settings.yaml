# EMA smoothing factor (higher = more weight on recent)
ema_alpha: 0.3

# Stability threshold
stability:
  min_attempts: 3       # Need 3 attempts before considered stable
  ema_ratio: 0.90       # ema_npm must be >= 90% of best_npm

# Scoring weights
# Note: There's typically 1 repeat candidate vs many exploration candidates
# So repeat needs a MUCH higher score to overcome the numbers
scoring:
  proximity_one_change: 1.0
  proximity_repeat: 2.0     # Much higher than one-change to overcome candidate count
  stability_ready: 2.0      # Strong bonus for stable parent
  stability_not_ready: 0.0  # Zero bonus for unstable parent - don't advance!
  novelty_max_days: 7
  novelty_weight: 0.1       # Minimal novelty chasing
  exploration_bonus: 0.05   # Tiny exploration bonus
